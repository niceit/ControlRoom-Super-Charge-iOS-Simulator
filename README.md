Control Room is a macOS app that lets you control the simulators for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS – their UI appearance, status bar configuration, and more. It wraps Apple’s own **simctl** command-line tool, so you’ll need Xcode installed.

`
You’ll need Xcode 12.0 or later to build and use Control Room on your Mac.

## Installation - Build Your Own Package

To try Control Room yourself, download the code and build it through Xcode. It’s built using SwiftUI, so you’ll need macOS Big Sur in order to run it. You will also need Xcode installed, because it relies on the **simctl** command being present – if you see an error that you’re missing the command line tools, go to Xcode's Preferences, choose the Locations tab, then make sure Xcode is selected for Command Line Tools.

**Warning:** SwiftUI on macOS is a little flaky at times, so I highly recommend you update to the very latest macOS version if you want to avoid any surprises.

## What it does?
